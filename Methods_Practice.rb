#Method Practice
#Translate important content into notebook eventually
#Command questionmark to comment large sections
#No caps for local_variables
#we cannot call other variables outside of the method
#method with an arguement
# your_name = "Alicia"

# def say_hello(your_name)
  
#   puts "Hello #{your_name}"
# end
# #call the method with the arguement
# say_hello("Alicia")
# say_hello("Lexi")
# say_hello("Ella")
def say_hello(your_name, my_name)
  puts "Hello #{your_name}! I'm #{my_name}"
end

say_hello("Alicia", "Someone")
